### Welcome to my personal website~

---

> 👩🏻‍🎓 I am a second-year [PhD candidate in Linguistics](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/chengcheng-wang(8174d49a-78dc-4f10-86dc-e0664029a8da).html) at the [LAnguages, Machines & Brains (LAMB) Lab](https://compneurolinglab.github.io/), City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Jixing Li](https://jixing-li.github.io/). My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary study combing linguistics, neuroscience and computer sciences to investigate how the human brain and large language models process language. I am particularly interested in the computational simulation of the impaired brain with language disorders. 

🙋🏻‍♀️ I like outdoor activities and enjoy climbing and hiking in HK. And I also enjoy drawing and designing appointment book (手帳う).
